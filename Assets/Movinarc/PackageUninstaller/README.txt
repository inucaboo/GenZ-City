Package Uninstaller v2.0
(c) 2021 Movinarc


// ABOUT ======================================

This plugin helps you remove and cleanup any assets you have imported, from your project. You no longer need to remove files one by one.

// REQUIREMENTS ===============================

- Unity Editor version 2018.x and above
- MacOS or Windows operating system

// HOW TO USE =================================

- Goto "Window/Package Uninstaller"
- Select from the list of the assets you have already imported from Asset Store or open the package you want to remove from your hard disk. 
- Click "Uninstall" to open the file selector window.
- Choose the contents you want to keep or remove.
- To remove Package Uninstaller asset itself, simply select it from the list and hit Uninstall!

// TROUBLESHOOTING ============================

- Package Uninstaller menu does not appear: When you import the Package Uninstaller, make sure that the Unity Editor builds the project successfully without any errors, at least once. Otherwise, the editor won't be able to add the menu (it's an almost common case for every utility asset). Don't forget to restart the editor afterwards. If that didn't solve the issue, close Unity editor. Then go to your project folder on your PC and remove all the sub-folders inside Movinarc folder, except the Assets folder.

- Some of the files are not removed after uninstalling the package: Package Uninstaller only removes the files/folders that are included inside the original asset that you've downloaded from Asset Store, not the ones which has been created after importing the asset. 

- I can't see my asset in the list of packages: That could be a problem of your Unity installation or corrupted files/folders. You can check that out or also manually locate the asset ('.unitypackage' file) from your computer, using the 'Browse' button.
